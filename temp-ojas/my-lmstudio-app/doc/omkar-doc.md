If this service wa s performed by an out-of-network provider without your knowledge, this could be a  surprise bill. 

Claims for surprise bills and emergency services from out-of-network providers  

You ha ve a  right to know a nd ask a  health care provider if they are in your plan’s network. When you receive non-emergency 

services, a  pa rticipating (network) facility or a  doctor m ust tell you if they involve a ny out-of-network providers in your care so 

you ca n a void a  surprise bill.  

What is a surprise bill? 

A surprise bill is a  bill you receive for covered services from an out-of-network provider in the following circumstances: 

1) You receive services a t a  network hospital or a mbulatory surgery center a nd:

•A network doctor wa s not a vaila ble a t the time the service wa s performed

•Or, the out-of-network provider performed the service without your knowledge.

2) A network provider does any of the following without your written consent:

•Refer you to an out-of-network provider

•Bring in a n out-of-network provider to treat you during your office visit

•Send your bloodwork to a n out-of-network la boratory.

3) After a n em ergency room visit on or a fter Ja nuary 1, 2020, you receive inpatient services at an out -of-network hospital or

from  a n out-of-network doctor a t a  network hospital.

Before you get services from a n out-of-network provider, they will need to get your written permission (consent). The consent 

form explains that if  you choose to use a n out-of-network provider, the cla im will be trea ted as out-of-network. If you have out-

of-network benefits, they will be used to pay the cla im. If you do not have out-of-network benefits, the claim will be denied for no 

coverage a nd you will be responsible for the full cost. The form also gives you the choice to select a network provider a nd use 

your network benefits. If you signed the form before using the out-of-network provider, this is not a surprise bill. If you were not 

given the form before you received services or you selected a network provider on the form, this could be a surprise bill.  

What will I owe for a surprise bill or emergency services? 

You will only need to pay your in -network deductible, copay or coinsurance.  

If you get a bill from a n out-of-network provider and believe it is a surprise bill or a bill for em ergency services, call the number 

on your health pla n ID card. Do not pay the provider. We m ay negotiate with the provider or pay an additional a mount to resolve 

the claim. We, or your provider, may also submit the claim for review through New York’s independent dispute resolution 

process. If we pa y a dditional amounts through these processes, your cost share may increase.  

For more information a bout em ergency a nd surprise bills, visit uhcsr.com. 

NY OON Provider Rights of Review for Emergency Room (ER) Services and Surprise Bills for Services Provided to 

Fully Insured Members in New York.  

What if a provider disagrees with the amount allowed on a claim? 

The provider may submit the dispute for review through New York’s independent dispute resolution process. After the 

dispute is resolved, the member’s cost share may increase if the health plan is told they must pay additional amounts. 

Plea se do not bill the m ember for a ny amount above their cost share (copay, coinsurance a nd deductible). 

How does the independent dispute resolution process work? 

A hea lth care provider or the hea lth plan may dispute a payment or charge for em ergency services, including inpatient 

physicia n a nd hospital services a fter a n emergency room visit, or for a  surprise bill.  Applica nts must: (1) visit the 

Depa rtment of Fina ncial Services (DFS) website at www.dfs.ny.gov to get a  file number; (2) complete the application; 

a nd (3) send the application a nd the requested information to the a ssigned independent dispute resolution entity (IDRE). 

For help ca ll 1-800-342-3736 or e-mail IDRquestions@dfs.ny.gov. 

New York Depa rtment of Financia l Services will select a n independent dispute resolution entity (IDRE) to review the 

disputed cla ims. The IDRE will request information about the services received a nd determine the reasonable fee for the 

services. The IDRE will  either request the parties to negotiate or issue a  decision a ccepting either the health plan’s 

pa yment amount or the provider’s billed charge.
